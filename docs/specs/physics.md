## Summary

- The `physics` module is the engine's 2D simulation authority for users who want motion, contact, shapes, joints, and collision queries to live inside one consistent world model.
- Bodies, colliders, forces, terrain, joints, sensors, and collision layers all belong to the same simulation step, which keeps movement and contact rules coherent across the engine.
- The module supports dynamic, static, kinematic, and sensor-style roles so projects can mix actors, level geometry, triggers, platforms, and detection-only regions inside one physical space without switching subsystems.
- Practical physics also depends on querying the world, not only advancing it. Raycasts, overlap checks, sweep-style tests, and contact inspection let gameplay ask what was hit, what overlaps, and why motion changed.
- Shape support, terrain integration, and joints give the system expressive range for characters, bullets, walls, pickups, hazards, linked mechanisms, and authored environment collision.
- Contact data is one of the main user-facing outputs because systems often need normals, hit points, and begin or end state changes to react meaningfully.
- That query surface is a major part of the module's identity. Many gameplay features care less about rigid-body theory than about dependable answers to questions such as where movement will stop, whether a region is occupied, what a sensor can currently detect, or which body pair produced a specific contact event.
- The module therefore acts as both simulator and spatial authority. It advances bodies through time, but it also explains the world back to scripts in terms of overlaps, hits, filters, material response, joints, and collision-layer policy.
- Terrain support matters because a large share of game physics is really about how actors relate to authored space. Ground, ramps, tile-derived obstacles, one-way behavior, ledges, and sensor volumes all need to participate in the same contact model or movement quickly becomes inconsistent.
- Joints and constraints extend the feature beyond isolated bodies into coupled systems such as hinges, chains, levers, suspended loads, doors, and puzzle machinery. Without that layer, several gameplay designs would need bespoke approximations instead of sharing engine-owned physical semantics.
- Filtering rules are equally important because not every shape should collide, trigger, block, or report in the same way. Keeping collision layers and response policy near world state lets projects express interaction rules explicitly rather than hiding them in scattered caller-side checks.
- Debug visualization is not just a convenience but a necessary part of the contract because collision tuning mistakes are difficult to reason about from code alone. Seeing shapes, sensors, normals, joints, and query paths turns the simulation into something inspectable instead of opaque.
- This makes `physics` especially important for grounded locomotion, projectile travel, hazard interaction, puzzle systems, traversal mechanics, and any design where contact semantics are part of gameplay rather than an incidental backend.
- The shared step loop gives other systems one trusted spatial authority for grounded movement, projectiles, puzzle machinery, and hazards instead of several drifting approximations.
- That authority is what lets gameplay, tools, and effects ask the same world-state questions without maintaining parallel collision logic.
- Other systems consume the results, but `physics` owns the source of truth for what counts as solid, colliding, constrained, or detectable in 2D space.

## Validation And Safety Contract

- Lua-facing body, shape, terrain, fixture, joint, and zone creation paths reject invalid numeric input instead of silently normalizing all failures.
- `BodyId` rejects negative Lua integers, so accidental `-1` inputs do not wrap into huge slot indices.
- Shape validation rejects non-finite coordinates, non-positive rectangle and circle sizes, degenerate polygons, invalid edge lengths, and malformed chain vertex lists before Rapier collider creation.
- Terrain constructors and deserializers enforce finite positive `cellSize`, checked dimension arithmetic, versioned byte headers, and allocation limits before creating cell buffers or image exports.
- Legacy APIs that still expose no-op or sentinel-return behavior for compatibility now increment world diagnostics so scripts can detect invalid operations through `LWorld:getStats()`.

## Stepping And Determinism

- `LWorld:step(dt)` rejects non-finite or non-positive `dt` values and does not forward them into Rapier.
- Large `dt` values are clamped to the configured world limit, and diagnostics record skipped and clamped steps.
- After a body is added, Rapier is the authoritative dynamic-body state. Mirror `Body` state only syncs back into Rapier when explicit setters mark that body dirty.
- `LWorld:stepFixed(accumulator, stepDt, maxSteps)` remains the preferred API for deterministic gameplay loops because it bounds substeps and reduces frame-time-driven drift.
- Stable body, joint, and zone slot ids are preserved until explicit destruction, but floating-point determinism is still bounded by Rapier and host-platform behavior.

## World Reset Policy

- `LWorld:clear()` removes runtime state such as bodies, joints, terrain colliders, and zones while preserving world-level configuration like gravity, solver iterations, and meter scale.
- `LWorld:resetWorld()` performs a full post-construction reset: it clears runtime state and restores constructor-owned settings such as the original gravity vector and default solver configuration.
- Use `clear()` when loading a new scene into the same tuned world configuration; use `resetWorld()` when the next scene should behave like a freshly created world.

## Diagnostics

- `LWorld:getStats()` returns active counts plus diagnostics: `skippedSteps`, `clampedSteps`, `invalidOperations`, `bodiesScanned`, `collidersRebuilt`, `zoneChecks`, `contacts`, and `syncedBodies`.
- These counters describe safety fallbacks and per-step work so scripts can audit invalid API use, oversized frame deltas, and expensive simulation updates without attaching a profiler.

- `math`: Imports or references `math` from `src/math/`.

## Files

### body.rs

- This file owns `BodyType`, `BodyShape`, and `Body`, the authored body descriptor used before and during world use.
- It stores simulation role, primitive shape, material settings, filters, pose, velocity, and optional extended geometry.
- Constructors cover rectangles, circles, polygons, edges, and chains so tools and gameplay code share one body surface.
- Geometry helpers expose bounding boxes plus local or world point conversion without requiring a live solver context.
- This file is the boundary between authored rigid-body intent and the runtime world that simulates those bodies.
- Open it when body payloads or authoring semantics change; stepping, queries, and zones live in sibling owners.

### collision.rs

- This file owns `CollisionInfo`, the stable collision payload used when contact results leave solver internals.
- It stores penetration depth and collision normal so gameplay systems can react without raw engine state.
- Open this file when exported contact payload fields change; overlap helpers and body simulation live elsewhere.

### collision_helpers.rs

- This file owns lightweight overlap helpers for AABBs, circles, and point tests without a full physics world.
- It provides stateless boolean queries used by gameplay code that only needs immediate geometric answers.
- Open this file when simple collision predicates change; buffered collision events and bodies live elsewhere.

### mod.rs

- This module re-exports the physics subsystem surface for bodies, shapes, zones, world stepping, and helpers.
- It keeps navigation explicit by mapping which sibling files own body descriptors, geometry, debug output, or zones.
- Public exports here route callers toward `World` for simulation and `Body` or `Shape` for authored physics state.
- `collision.rs` and `collision_helpers.rs` own contact payloads and lightweight overlap checks outside full stepping.
- `body.rs`, `shape.rs`, and `zone.rs` define the core authored inputs that later feed the runtime world owner.
- Change this file when the public physics symbol map moves; change siblings when simulation data rules change.

### render.rs

- This file owns the physics debug-render bridge that turns simulation state into engine commands and preview images.
- It walks world bodies, colors them by body type, draws shape outlines, and adds velocity arrows for movers.
- The image path rasterizes the same data into `ImageData`, making physics inspection available without the renderer.
- This is the right owner for visualization semantics, not stepping logic, contact generation, or body storage rules.
- Open it when debug draw output changes; runtime world integration and authored shapes live in sibling files.

### shape.rs

- This file owns `Shape` and `StandaloneShape`, the geometry vocabulary used by bodies and standalone collision pieces.
- It stores circles, rectangles, polygons, edges, and chains, then converts valid inputs into Rapier colliders.
- Parsing helpers and regular-polygon generation let scripts or data describe intent without building raw engine types.
- Standalone shapes keep density, friction, restitution, and sensor flags next to geometry for authored test fixtures.
- Local bounding-box helpers make shapes inspectable in tools and previews without a live body or physics world.
- Open this file when geometry semantics change; body ownership and world stepping remain in sibling files.

### terrain.rs

- This file owns `TerrainMap`, a chunked solid-cell grid that rebuilds static physics bodies only where edits occur.
- It stores map dimensions, cell scale, world offsets, per-cell solidity, spawned chunk body ids, and dirty chunks.
- Editing helpers flip single cells or fill circles, rectangles, and whole maps so gameplay can carve or restore terrain.
- Flush logic removes stale chunk colliders, merges horizontal solid runs, and respawns compact static bodies in `World`.
- Collapse and debris helpers support destructible terrain flows by pruning unsupported cells and spawning fragments.
- Image and byte serialization make the same terrain usable for previews, saves, reloads, and external authoring tools.
- Open this file when terrain editing or sync semantics change; body simulation and contact solving live in siblings.

### types.rs

- This file owns `BodyId`, the stable typed identifier used to reference bodies across the physics subsystem.
- It wraps raw slot indices with conversions, display formatting, and Lua bridging so body handles stay explicit.
- Open this file when body-handle representation changes; world storage and body descriptors live in sibling owners.
- This is the right owner for changing Rust or Lua identity semantics without touching simulation behavior directly.

### world.rs

- This file owns `World`, the Rapier-backed runtime that stores live bodies, colliders, joints, and zones.
- It mirrors authored `Body` data into Rapier sets, keeps stable ids, and tracks tombstones for removed slots.
- Stepping syncs scripted state into Rapier, runs the solver pipeline, then writes motion back into body mirrors.
- Collision handling buffers begin and end contact pairs plus overlap events so gameplay reads post-step results.
- Contact and stats helpers summarize active manifolds, sleeping bodies, collider counts, and joint counts.
- Spatial query helpers provide filtered raycasts, AABB scans, and point tests against the same world state.
- Fixture APIs let one body carry multiple colliders, while rebuild paths refresh filters and materials after edits.
- Joint APIs create revolute, rope, prismatic, weld, wheel, friction, motor, and mouse constraints with stable ids.
- Joint utilities also expose motor speeds, limits, break thresholds, connected bodies, and explicit destruction paths.
- Zone integration applies priority-ordered gravity and damping overrides, then emits enter and leave events per body.
- One-way platform handling and sleep controls adapt raw solver behavior to platformer-style gameplay expectations.
- Meter conversion helpers keep pixel-authored content aligned with simulation units without spreading scale math.
- Debug extraction exposes shape snapshots and image drawing support so tools can inspect runtime geometry easily.
- Open this file when runtime ownership or physics behavior changes; pure shape and zone definitions live nearby.

### zone.rs

- This file owns `PhysicsZone`, `ZoneBoundary`, `ZoneGravityMode`, and tracker events for area-based rule overrides.
- It stores zone shape, gravity behavior, damping overrides, priority, filters, and enabled state in one owner.
- Zone helpers configure rectangles or circles, directional gravity, point attraction, repulsion, and zero-gravity fields.
- The tracker caches body membership so enter and leave transitions can feed gameplay events as well as force changes.
- This file is the boundary for area effects driven by position rather than by rigid contact against solid geometry.
- Open it when zone semantics change; body descriptors and world stepping rules live in sibling owners.
