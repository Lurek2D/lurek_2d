# progression

## TL;DR

- `lurek.progression` is the canonical offline-first progression store for counters, stats-like data, resources, XP, achievements, quests, rewards, event history, seasons, rivals, deterministic virtual populations, and initial transport-neutral changesets.
- The initial implementation is headless and deterministic.
- Legacy-style stats and quest adapters now live directly inside `lurek.progression`, so old gameplay patterns can migrate without keeping separate `library.stats` or `library.quest` modules.

## Summary

`lurek.progression` introduces a store-based progression model under `src/progression/` and exposes it to Lua as `lurek.progression`.

The current slice includes:

- isolated stores with logical time and bounded events;
- profiles with tags and metadata;
- counter definitions and threshold events;
- shared condition compile/validate/evaluate/explain helpers for counter, achievement, quest, tag, all/any/not checks;
- initial derived-value definitions with named progression inputs, arithmetic expressions, validation, and explanations;
- initial profile template definitions with authored counter, attribute, resource, XP, tag, and metadata seeding;
- initial trait and perk definitions with canonical per-profile trait activation and perk-granted trait unlocks;
- initial skill definitions with learned levels, attribute-backed costs, manual use, and cooldown ticking through store updates;
- initial leaderboard definitions with deterministic ranking, manual score submission, counter-backed score sources, top/range/around-profile queries, and top-threshold movement events;
- initial season definitions with manual logical start/end control, optional archive snapshots, and reset hooks for selected counters and leaderboards;
- initial prestige definitions with level-gated rebirth checks, selected counter/level resets, preserved achievement state, and lifetime counter carry-forward;
- initial collections with achievement-set items, hidden codex-style discoveries, completion percentage, and optional meta-achievement unlocks;
- initial challenge templates with manual or counter-driven progress, activation windows, status filters, expiry, and reward records;
- initial rivals with leaderboard-aware delta queries, overtake events, and a bounded local activity feed derived from retained progression events;
- initial virtual population templates with deterministic identity generation, leaderboard-backed lightweight profiles, logical-time simulation, materialization/dematerialization, and leaderboard participation without a network service;
- attributes, resources, modifiers, and XP/level tracks;
- achievements with manual and counter-triggered unlocks;
- reward records with pending, claimed, applied, and rejected states;
- quest definitions with reveal and availability lifecycle, manual progress, canonical journal entries, visible/hidden objectives, explicit objective status overrides, counter-driven objectives, and quest rewards;
- transaction batching, debug snapshots, bounded changeset envelopes with schema/hash validation, ack/compaction helpers, and compatibility `exportChangesSince` / `applyChangeset` support built from retained revision snapshots;
- initial changeset merge policies with conflict reports for local profile divergence and quest-branch mismatches;
- malformed or oversized changesets are rejected before snapshot application;
- legacy import helpers for snapshots produced by the former `library.stats` and `library.quest` flows.

The module is intentionally headless. It owns data and mutation rules only.

## Notes

- Use `clock = "manual"` for deterministic tests and offline simulation.
- Store and transaction APIs are designed so later roadmap phases can extend the module without changing the top-level ownership model.
- New gameplay code should use `lurek.progression` directly; the legacy adapter surface is now provided by that engine module instead of separate Lua libraries.
