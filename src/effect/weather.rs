//! Weather particle system data.
//!
//! Defines [`WeatherType`], [`WeatherParticle`], and [`WeatherState`]
//! for rain, snow, and dust particle overlays.

/// Weather particle types supported by the overlay system.
///
/// Each variant changes the visual character of spawned particles: their
/// fall speed, size, and opacity are all tuned per type inside
/// `Overlay::spawn_particle`. The `None` variant disables the spawner
/// without clearing existing particles — call `Overlay::clear` to purge
/// everything at once.
///
/// # Variants
/// - `None` — No weather active; spawner is disabled.
/// - `Rain` — Fast, narrow, semi-transparent streaks.
/// - `Snow` — Slow, large, high-opacity dots with gentle drift.
/// - `Hail` — Very fast, opaque, medium-sized pellets.
/// - `Dust` — Very slow, small, low-opacity motes.
/// - `Leaves` — Medium speed, large, high-opacity irregular blobs.
/// - `Ash` — Slow, small, medium-opacity flakes.
/// - `Pollen` — Extremely slow, tiny, low-opacity specks.

/// # Fields
/// - `x` — `f32` — Horizontal position in screen pixels.
